Question:

- A website requires users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users. Following are the `criteria` for checking the password:

1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
3. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
4. At least 1 character from [$#@]
5. Minimum length of the transaction password: 6
6. Minimum length of the transaction password: 12

- Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria.

- Passwords that `match` the criteria are to be printed, each seperated by a comma.

1. Example: If the following passwords are given as input to the program: `ABd1234@1, a F1#, 2w3E*, 2We3345`
2. Then, the output of the program should be: ABd1234@1
